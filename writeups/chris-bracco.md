# Chris Braccoâ€™s Writeup

> A writeup about my experience on Team 12 of the MD Hackathon on Feb 24-26 2017.

## Timeline

Before the hackathon started, our team members were shuffled around a few times. The student who first volunteered to be the Team 12 project manager got assigned to another team after already creating a Trello board and Slack channel for our team. After the student left our team, I volunteered to take the project manager role and began by creating a new Trello board, Slack channel, and GitHub repository for Team 12.
